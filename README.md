### RESTful API Endpoints

#### Task Management:

1. **Create Task**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /tasks`
   - **Description:** Adds a new task with details such as title, description, priority, due date, and category.

2. **Get All Tasks**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /tasks`
   - **Description:** Retrieves all tasks, with optional query parameters to filter by category, priority, or due date.

3. **Get Task by ID**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /tasks/{taskId}`
   - **Description:** Fetches the details of a specific task based on its ID.

4. **Update Task**
   - **Endpoint:** `PUT /tasks/{taskId}`
   - **Description:** Updates the attributes of an existing task.

5. **Delete Task**
   - **Endpoint:** `DELETE /tasks/{taskId}`
   - **Description:** Removes a task from the database.

6. **Batch Update Tasks**
   - **Endpoint:** `PATCH /tasks/batch`
   - **Description:** Allows updating multiple tasks at once, such as changing status or category. It is designed to utilize concurrency for efficient processing.

#### Task Categorization:

1. **Create Category**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /categories`
   - **Description:** Creates a new task category with a name and description.

2. **Get All Categories**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /categories`
   - **Description:** Retrieves a list of all categories along with their descriptions.

3. **Update Category**
   - **Endpoint:** `PUT /categories/{categoryId}`
   - **Description:** Updates the name or description of an existing category.

4. **Delete Category**
   - **Endpoint:** `DELETE /categories/{categoryId}`
   - **Description:** Deletes a specific category. Requires handling tasks that may be associated with the category.

### Database Tables

#### Task Table

- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each task.
  - `title`: Title of the task.
  - `description`: Detailed description of the task.
  - `priority`: Priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
  - `due_date`: The due date for the task completion.
  - `category_id`: Foreign key linking to the Category table.
  - `status`: Current status of the task (e.g., Pending, Completed).

#### Category Table

- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each category.
  - `name`: Name of the category.
  - `description`: Description of what the category is about.

### Implementation Notes

- **Framework and Libraries**: Choose frameworks and libraries that are idiomatic to the language (Go or Rust) for web server setup, routing, handling requests, and interacting with the database.
- **Concurrency**: For endpoints like the batch update, leverage the concurrency features of Go (goroutines and channels) or Rust (async/await, threads) to improve performance.
- **Security and Validation**: Implement necessary validations for input data to prevent SQL injection and ensure data integrity. Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Testing**: Develop unit and integration tests to cover the functionality of your endpoints and database operations.
- **Documentation**: Document your API using tools like Swagger or Postman to make it easy for other developers to understand and use your API.

This comprehensive setup offers a solid foundation for learning about web API development, database management, and concurrency in Go or Rust, along with the application of best practices in software development.
